# Board Game Collection

Welcome to our Board Game Collection project! This repository contains implementations of three unique board games, each offering a different style of play and strategy. Below is a brief overview of the games available in this collection.

## Games Available

### 1. Butin
- **Game Style:** Butin is a multi-player game played on a checkerboard filled with pieces of three different colors. The objective is to capture these pieces, with each color representing a different value. Players aim to maximize their total capture value.

### 2. Checkers
- **Game Style:** A classic game known for its strategic depth. The game starts with an initial confrontation phase, progressing towards the enemy lines. A unique feature is the promotion of a 'pawn' piece to a 'king,' offering more powerful moves.

### 3. Bulltricker
- **Game Style:** Similar to traditional checkers but with unique variations. It involves more complex strategies and offers a different board layout, making it a challenging yet enjoyable game.

## Differences and Similarities
Each game, while distinct in its rules and playstyle, shares a common theme of strategic movement and capture. They all use a checkerboard but differ in their objectives, piece movements, and overall strategies. This project demonstrates the versatility of board games and the varied experiences they can offer.

## Installation and Execution
- **Compilation:** Run `make` in the project root.
- **Execution:** From the build directory, execute `./boardgame`.

Enjoy exploring the different strategies and challenges each game offers!
